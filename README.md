# Discord-Code-Snippets

Discord-Code-Snippets is a [Discord](https://discord.com/) bot, made with [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/). Its a very simple bot to save snippets of code or text. The size of the snippet depends on the discord character limit. I will probably add a database system to be able to make private snippets, and make it so snippets can be saved for specific servers.

## Installation

Install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Create a Discord bot application on the [Discord portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

Rename `config.example.json` to `config.json`, and fill in the secrets.

Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

## Usage

Run `npm start` to start Discord-Code-Snippets.
